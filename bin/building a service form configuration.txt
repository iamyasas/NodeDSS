server.get('/Employee', getAllEmp);
server.get('/Employee/:id', getEmpById);


server.get -- if verb is GET

function getAllEmp(req, res, next) {
	//get connection accordingly and open it

	//call query or queries for the connection assign results to an array

	connection.query('SELECT * from emp where id = ?', [req.params.id], function(err, results, fields){
			sendResults(err, results, fields, res)
	});

	//close the connection

	(if more connections)

	//get connection accordingly and open it

	//call query or queries for the connection assign results to the same array

	//close the connection
}
